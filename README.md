<H3>üìÑ SketchUp Pro Description:</H3>

SketchUP Pro is a professional version of an application that allows you to create 3D models, 
show them as a presentation, and share them. 
The program will be useful wherever there is a need to use 3D models, be it designing an extension for a house, 
teaching geometry to schoolchildren or creating a model for Google Earth. 
Many simple tools and the use of an intelligent drawing system allow you to easily create and edit models, 
export them, create a video or print the results. Instead of entering coordinate values, 
you can use a multifunctional system to control the location of an object using labels, 
text hints, and lines of different colors. Using the tools is as close to real life as possible, 
because it is much easier to learn and, most importantly, to remember how to use them.
